# OOP

## What is Object-Orientated Programing?

- Object orientated programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects
- We use objects to **_model_** (describe) real-world or abstract features
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack **_data and the corresponding behavior_** into one block
- In OOP, objects are **_self-contained_** pieces/blocks of code
- Objects are **_building blocks_** of applications, and **_interact_** with one another
- Interactions through a **_public interface_** (API): Methods that the code **_outside_** of the object can access and use to communicate with the object
- OOP was developed with the goal of **_organizing_** code, to make it **_more flexible and easier to maintain_**

## Classes and instances (traditional OOP)

- **_Classes_** are like **_blueprints_** from which we can create new objects
- **_Inheritance_** makes all properties and methods of a certain class **_available to a child class_**, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allows us to **_reuse common logic_** and to model real-world relationships.
- **_Child Class Extends Parent Class_**
- **_Child Class_** can have its own **_methods_** and **_properties_**
