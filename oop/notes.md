# OOP

- Object orientated programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects
- We use objects to **model** (describe) real-world or abstract features
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack **data and the corresponding behavior** into one block
- In OOP, objects are **self-contained** pieces/blocks of code
- Objects are **building blocks** of applications, and **interact** with one another
- Interactions through a **public interface** (API): Methods that the code **outside** of the object can access and use to communicate with the object
