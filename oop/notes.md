# OOP

## What is Object-Orientated Programing?

- Object orientated programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects
- We use objects to _model_ (describe) real-world or abstract features
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack _data and the corresponding behavior_ into one block
- In OOP, objects are _self-contained_ pieces/blocks of code
- Objects are _building blocks_ of applications, and _interact_ with one another
- Interactions through a _public interface_ (API): Methods that the code _outside_ of the object can access and use to communicate with the object
- OOP was developed with the goal of _organizing_ code, to make it _more flexible and easier to maintain_

## Classes and instances (traditional OOP)

- Classes are like _blueprints_ from which we can create new objects
